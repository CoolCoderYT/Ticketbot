# Discord-ticketbot
Feel free to Self-Host this bot :D

# Installation

npm install (make sure the package.json is there)

# Setup

1. Edit the config.json and edit whatever that matches your needs.

2. After that you would want to edit the files located in commands folder because you need to change the category name and the allowed roles in order for it to work.

# Commands

!new reason = creates a new ticket
  
!support reason = creates a new ticket
  
!help = the bot sends an embedded message with whatever commands you have added in the list
  
!ticket close, remove, add = either one of them, close should be executed in the channel, add should be executed in the channel and the user must be mentioned and same goes with remove
  
# Issues

If you are having any trouble running the script, you are free to open an issue and I will have a look.
